                  I'm a people person who also loves code. I enjoy leveraging my
                  engineering skills to make the internet a less scary place for
                  the folks at home. I live and breathe HTML, CSS, JavaScript
                  and React, and I've also dabbled with Node, Angular and Ruby
                  on Rails. If I'm not learning, I'm not happy.

              Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken,
              but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional
              period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't
              give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already
              been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it
              over to your dumb ass.{' '}

              You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it
              has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste
              for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out.
              Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know
              that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out.
              Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it
              was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
              lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.{' '}
