      <p>
        My work experience has been quite varied, but it's always had the same
        unifying themes: working hard, taking ownership, paying attention to
        detail, and learning unbelievably fast. And that's how I like it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last few years I've worked in the software as a service sector, for
        content management platform vendors. The work is an interesting mix of
        product, agency, and consultancy work, so I've worn every hat you can
        imagine. I've owned projects, joined sales calls, lead teams, faced down
        timelines, managed client accounts, developed complex renderings - you
        name it, I've done it. I started out a few years ago as a Junior
        Developer, and have since held titles as Solutions Engineer, Midlevel
        Developer, and now as Technical Lead, delivering a full site build out
        to a client in Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked primarily with React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack,
        JSP/JSTL, SCSS, Enzyme, Jest, and Regex. If you're interested in some of
        my work, select a partner logo to the left to see their site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I was a developer, I worked in fundraising and as a bartender.
        And I ought to tell you, not to brag, just so you know: I serve a hell
        of a Budweiser.
